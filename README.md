## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose the Ebola 2014-2016 dataset. 

I decided to explore the 2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak Dataset in light of the Coronavirus pandemic. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. The Ebola Outbreak started in 2013 and I wanted to see the correlation between location and number of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases and deaths. I will answer three questions from this dataset. 

They are the following:

1. What year had the highest percentage for suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola deaths?

2. What were the increases in suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola cases by year?

3. Which country had the highest number of Ebola cases and Ebola deaths?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

ebola_2014_2016_clean.csv has countries, dates, and suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola cases and Ebola deaths as columns.

ebola_data_db_format.csv has indicators, which are the suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola cases and Ebola deaths, countries, dates, and values for each indicator.

There is also a jupyter notebook here that shows all of my work related to the three questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at this available [post](https://medium.com/@rocketmaninspace/how-did-location-affect-the-spread-of-the-2013-ebola-outbreak-cad9cbceccaa).
